Optimize your product pages for search engines and AI language models, generate high-quality content with AI, and manage XML sitemaps efficiently

== Description ==

CranSEO is a powerful WordPress plugin designed to enhance your content's visibility and performance for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides real-time analysis and actionable suggestions to optimize your posts, pages, and WooCommerce products ensuring they are conversational, relevant, and well-structured. With both free and premium features, CranSEO caters to bloggers, marketers, store-owners and developers aiming to improve their content's discoverability in AI-driven search environments.

==WooCommerce Optimization==
CranSEO includes a dedicated optimization engine for WooCommerce products, helping store owners create product pages that are not only search-friendly but also highly visible to LLMs and AI-driven search engines.

**How It Works: Step-by-Step**
*Enter a Seed Keyword*
The user begins by entering a focus keyword — the main term they want the product to rank for. This keyword will guide the optimization process.

*Click “Analyze Product”*
With one click, CranSEO scans the product’s title, description, and short product description for SEO and LLM optimization factors.

*Get Real-Time Scoring & Suggestions*
The plugin then displays:
* A comprehensive SEO score for the product
* Suggestions to improve keyword placement
* Warnings for missing or weak elements
* Tips to make the content more conversational and structured

**Optimization Targets**
*Short Product Description*
Ensures this snippet is compelling and keyword-rich — ideal for appearing in quick previews or featured listings.

*Long Description*
Analyzes for content depth, structure, internal links, and relevance to LLM queries (e.g., FAQs, benefits, comparisons).

**Built-in Product SEO Scoring**
Each WooCommerce product is scored based on:
* Keyword relevance and density
* Conversational tone and clarity
* Content structure (headings, bullets, etc.)
* Link usage and metadata completeness
* LLM compatibility (Is the content likely to be cited or used by AI?)

**Why it matters**
Most WooCommerce SEO plugins focus on meta tags — CranSEO goes further by optimizing the actual product content for visibility in LLM-powered platforms like ChatGPT, Google’s AI Overviews, and voice search.

==XML Sitemaps==
CranSEO automatically generates a complete and compliant XML sitemap to help search engines easily discover and index all your important content — including pages, posts, products, categories, and custom taxonomies.

**What It Includes**
The sitemap dynamically includes:
* Pages – All published static pages
* Posts – Blog articles and other post types
* WooCommerce Products – Product pages with SEO relevance
* Categories & Tags – Blog and product categories/tags
* Custom Taxonomies – Including WooCommerce product attributes or any CPT taxonomy

**Search Engine Ready**
Once generated, users can submit the sitemap directly to major search engines (like Google and Bing) via:
* Google Search Console
* Bing Webmaster Tools
* Manual submission or plugin integrations

The sitemap is located at:
yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml

**Automatic Updates**
CranSEO ensures your sitemap:
Updates automatically when new content is published
Removes deleted content from the index
It has timestamps to show when you update the content

**Why Sitempas Matter**
* Search engines rely on sitemaps to:
* Discover your content faster
* Understand your site structure
* Prioritize what to crawl and index
* And in the AI era, structured sitemaps help LLMs and bots find and contextualize your content better — especially when paired with CranSEO’s content optimization.
