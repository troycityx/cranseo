Optimize your product pages for search engines and AI language models, generate high-quality content with AI, and manage XML sitemaps efficiently

== Description ==

CranSEO is a powerful WordPress plugin designed to enhance your content's visibility and performance for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides real-time analysis and actionable suggestions to optimize your posts, pages, and WooCommerce products ensuring they are conversational, relevant, and well-structured. With both free and premium features, CranSEO caters to bloggers, marketers, store-owners and developers aiming to improve their content's discoverability in AI-driven search environments.

CranSEO integrates seamlessly with both the Classic Editor and Gutenberg, offering a user-friendly interface for real-time content analysis, keyword management, and summary optimization.

==WooCommerce Optimization==
CranSEO includes a dedicated optimization engine for WooCommerce products, helping store owners create product pages that are not only search-friendly but also highly visible to LLMs and AI-driven search engines.

**How It Works: Step-by-Step**
*Click “Analyze Product”*
With one click, CranSEO scans the product’s title, description, and short product description for SEO and LLM optimization factors.

*Get Real-Time Scoring & Suggestions*
The plugin then displays:
1. A comprehensive SEO score for the product
2. Suggestions to improve keyword placement
3. Warnings for missing or weak elements
4. Tips to make the content more conversational and structured

**Optimization Targets**
*Short Product Description*
Ensures this snippet is compelling and keyword-rich — ideal for appearing in quick previews or featured listings.

*Long Description*
Analyzes for content depth, structure, and relevance to LLM queries (e.g., FAQs, benefits, comparisons).

**Built-in Product SEO Scoring**
Each WooCommerce product is scored based on:
1. Keyword relevance and density
2. Conversational tone and clarity
3. Content structure (headings, bullets, etc.)
4. Link usage and metadata completeness
5. LLM compatibility (Is the content likely to be cited or used by AI?)

**Why it matters**
Most WooCommerce SEO plugins focus on meta tags — CranSEO goes further by optimizing the actual product content for visibility in LLM-powered platforms like ChatGPT, Google’s AI Overviews, and voice search.

==XML Sitemaps==
CranSEO automatically generates a complete and compliant XML sitemap to help search engines easily discover and index all your important content — including pages, posts, products, categories, and custom taxonomies.

**What It Includes**
The sitemap dynamically includes:
1. Pages – All published static pages
2. Posts – Blog articles and other post types
3. WooCommerce Products – Product pages with SEO relevance
4. Categories & Tags – Blog and product categories/tags
5. Custom Taxonomies – Including WooCommerce product attributes or any CPT taxonomy

**Search Engine Ready**
Once generated, users can submit the sitemap directly to major search engines (like Google and Bing) via:
1. Google Search Console
2. Bing Webmaster Tools
3. Manual submission or plugin integrations

The sitemap is located at:
yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml

**Automatic Updates**
CranSEO ensures your sitemap:
1. Updates automatically when new content is published
2. Removes deleted content from the index
3. It has timestamps to show when you update the content

**Why Sitempas Matter**
*Search engines rely on sitemaps to:*
1. Discover your content faster
2. Understand your site structure
3. Prioritize what to crawl and index
4. And in the AI era, structured sitemaps help LLMs and bots find and contextualize your content better — especially when paired with CranSEO’s content optimization.
